## About
I hope that this approach give you a well-rounded overview of the language.

This handbook does not try to cover everything under the sun related to C. It focuses on the core of the language, trying to simplify the more complex topics.

This is a guide for students by a student. Happy Coding!

## Computational Thinking

> *"Solving human's problems by analisis and system conception that simulate human behavior against that problem."*
> **Seiji Isotani**

That was a phrase that i heard from a incredible teacher in my first year of Computer Engineer in Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP). And was a really time changer in my mentality as a student.

Computers can be used to help us solve problems. However, before a problem can be tackled, the problem itself and the ways in which it could be solved need to be understood.

Computational Thinking is a problem-solving approach that integrates across activities, and programming is the practice of developing a set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute, as well as debugging.

#### Four main aspects of Computational Thinking

* **Decomposition:** Breaking down a big problem into small, manageable parts
* **Pattern Recognition:** Observing similarities and patterns in these smaller parts, to help us solve complex problems more efficiently
* **Abstraction:** Identifying and extracting the important parts of the problem
* **Algorithm:** Creating the step-by-step instructions of solving the problem

> *"Computational thinking is a way humans solve problems; it is not trying to get humans to think like computers. Computers are dull and boring; humans are clever and imaginative. We humans make computers exciting."* Jeanette M. Wing,

## Algorithm

An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation. Algorithms act as an exact list of instructions that conduct specified actions step by step in either hardware- or software-based routines.

It can be understood by taking the example of cooking a new recipe. To cook a new recipe, one reads the instructions and steps and executes them one by one, in the given sequence. The result thus obtained is the new dish cooked perfectly.

### Types of Algorithms:

There are several types of algorithms available. Some important algorithms are:

* **Brute Force Algorithm:** It is the simplest approach for a problem. A brute force algorithm is the first approach that comes to finding when we see a problem.

* **Recursive Algorithm:** A recursive algorithm is based on recursion. In this case, a problem is broken into several sub-parts and called the same function again and again.

* **Backtracking Algorithm:** The backtracking algorithm basically builds the solution by searching among all possible solutions. Using this algorithm, we keep on building the solution following criteria. Whenever a solution fails we trace back to the failure point and build on the next solution and continue this process till we find the solution or all possible solutions are looked after.

* **Searching Algorithm:** Searching algorithms are the ones that are used for searching elements or groups of elements from a particular data structure. They can be of different types based on their approach or the data structure in which the element should be found.

* **Sorting Algorithm:** Sorting is arranging a group of data in a particular manner according to the requirement. The algorithms which help in performing this function are called sorting algorithms. Generally sorting algorithms are used to sort groups of data in an increasing or decreasing manner.

* **Hashing Algorithm:** Hashing algorithms work similarly to the searching algorithm. But they contain an index with a key ID. In hashing, a key is assigned to specific data.

* **Divide and Conquer Algorithm:** This algorithm breaks a problem into sub-problems, solves a single sub-problem and merges the solutions together to get the final solution. It consists of the following three steps: Divide , Solve and Combine

* **Greedy Algorithm:** In this type of algorithm the solution is built part by part. The solution of the next part is built based on the immediate benefit of the next part. The one solution giving the most benefit will be chosen as the solution for the next part.

* **Dynamic Programming Algorithm:** This algorithm uses the concept of using the already found solution to avoid repetitive calculation of the same part of the problem. It divides the problem into smaller overlapping subproblems and solves them.

* **Randomized Algorithm:** In the randomized algorithm we use a random number so it gives immediate benefit. The random number helps in deciding the expected outcome.

## Pseudocode

In computer science, pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. 

## Programming Language

A programming language is a way for programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. Programming languages consist of a set of rules that allows string values to be converted into various ways of generating machine code, or, in the case of visual programming languages, graphical elements.

## What is C?

C is a general-purpose computer programming language created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.

It has found lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol stacks, though decreasingly for application software. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.

C is an imperative procedural language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support.
