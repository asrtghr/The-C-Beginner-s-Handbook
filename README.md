I hope that this approach give you a well-rounded overview of the language.

This handbook does not try to cover everything under the sun related to C. It focuses on the core of the language, trying to simplify the more complex topics.

This is a guide for students by a student. Happy Coding!

## Computational Thinking

> *"Solving human's problems by analisis and system conception that simulate human behavior against that problem."*
> **Seiji Isotani**

That was a phrase that i heard from a incredible teacher in my first year of Computer Engineer in Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP). And was a really time changer in my mentality as a student.

Computers can be used to help us solve problems. However, before a problem can be tackled, the problem itself and the ways in which it could be solved need to be understood.

Computational Thinking is a problem-solving approach that integrates across activities, and programming is the practice of developing a set of instructions that a computer can understand and execute, as well as debugging.

#### Four main aspects of Computational Thinking

* **Decomposition:** Breaking down a big problem into small, manageable parts
* **Pattern Recognition:** Observing similarities and patterns in these smaller parts, to help us solve complex problems more efficiently
* **Abstraction:** Identifying and extracting the important parts of the problem
* **Algorithm:** Creating the step-by-step instructions of solving the problem

> *"Computational thinking is a way humans solve problems; it is not trying to get humans to think like computers. Computers are dull and boring; humans are clever and imaginative. We humans make computers exciting."* Jeanette M. Wing,
